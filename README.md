# Demo Angular Application 

This project is supposed to be a template to start a project with Angular 8 which required a authentication system with JWT (Json Web Token).

## Back-end

The back-end part is faked with an interceptor, you can remove it and connect this application to your own.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
